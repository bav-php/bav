    - [API 1.2] renamed HTTPHeader::getVersion() and setVersion() to getHTTPVersion()
      and setHTTPVersion()
    
    - changed validator 57
    
    - implemented validators B9, C0, C1, C2


Version 0.11 - December 4, 2005
-------------------------------
    - added optional constant BAV_UPDATE_TMP to enter a writable directory for
      temporary files.

    - Bundesbank thinks that's a good idea to terminate a line by \n *or* by \r\n.
      So BAV_BUNDESBANK_LINE_LENGTH was removed, as BAV_BankFactory_BinarySearch has
      to find it automatically.


Version 0.10 - October 5, 2005
------------------------------
    - implemented new validators: B6, B7, B8

    - moved test/SQL.php to test/sql/*.php
    
    - added BAV_Version.
     
    - [API 1.1] BAV::getVersion() and BAV::getAPIVersion() are returning BAV_Version objects.
    
    - [API 1.1] corrected the typo "weight" in validator classes.
      
    - BAV_BankSaver_Bundesbank::save() uses rename() which doesn't work on PHP before 4.3.3 on
      different partitions. This is fixed now.


Version 0.9 - May 29, 2005
--------------------------
    - renamed BAV_Bank::getNewAccount() to BAV_Bank::getAccount()
    
    - renamed BAV_Validator::validate() to BAV_Validator::getValidatorResult()
    
    - renamed BAV_Account::validate() to BAV_Account::getValidatorResult()
    
    - renamed BAV_Controller::validate() to BAV_Controller::getValidatorResult()
    
    - BAV_Bank::validate() is deprecated, BAV_Bank::getValidatorResult() added

    - removed BAV_Bank::getBLZ(), which is since some versions marked as deprecated
    
    - added BAV::getVersion() and BAV::getAPIVersion()

    - added some more tests
    
    - added BAV_SQL_PearDB
    
    - added -v option in bav.php
    
    - added BAV_SQL_Connection which is the parent class for all DBS which work with connections.
      So the ancient classes BAV_SQL_MySQL, BAV_SQL_Postgres and BAV_SQL_SQLite moved to 
      connection/BAV_SQL_Connection_*.php
      
    - moved sql configuration to config/sql/*
    
    - All BAV_SQL_Connection classes can now be initialized by an existing connection
          
    - the Bundesbank released a new bank file
    
    - added protected method BAV_Validator::isValidType()
    
    - changed BAV_BankSaver
    
    - deleted scripts/bav_install.php
    
    - added scripts/update.php
    
    - added BAV_SQL::replaceTable()


Version 0.8 - April 24, 2005
----------------------------
    - Bundesbank changed validator 90

    - Bundesbank added validator B5
      I'm not sure if it's correct, as it says that 1151043211 is valid, but the Bundesbank says
      it should be wrong at the first validator. It is wrong at the first validator, but the
      second validator says it's valid and so it's valid for the complete B5.
      
    - Added a new BankFactory which works on the Bundesbank file. The new factory is fast, as it
      uses a binary search (it even may be improved by better handling of the '00000000' exception).
      And it needs only an unmodified file of the Bundesbank. So it became the new default factory.
      
    - Changed BAV_BankFactory_File_Hashtable and BAV_BankFactory_File_Bundesbank to
      BAV_BankFactory_Hashtable and BAV_BankFactory_Hashtable_Bundesbank.
      
    - added new directory test/ and moved scripts/checkValidators.php to it.


Version 0.7e - April 4, 2005
----------------------------
    - BAV_BankFactory_File::bankExists() and BAV_BankFactory_SQL::bankExists() were overwritten.
      BAV_SQL gets a getFoundRows().
    
    - Repaired validators: 44, 90
    
    - added test to find missing require_onces.
    
    - added require_once BAV_CLASS_PATH.'validator/BAV_Validator.php':
      88, A6, 93_Aux
      
    - My SQLite Version doesn't understand LIMIT in UPDATE. So a statement changed.
      
    - Implemented specification change of A8
    
    - Implemented B4


Version 0.7d - November 29, 2004
--------------------------------
    - Bundesbank changed 73
    
    - Bundesbank specified B0 and B3.  

    
Version 0.7c - October 20, 2004
-------------------------------
    - changed the shebang line from /usr/local/bin/php to /usr/bin/php.
      If you use the scripts you should modify it anyway!

    - fixed validator 52 again - Thanks to Enrico Stahn

    - fixed 53, but there seems to be one bug left

    - checkValidators.php was rewritten and supports now bank IDs in the
      verify.ini

    - reimplemented validators: 20

    - reimplemented because of specification change: 51, 73, 80, 81, 84, 86, 87

    - little change of the verify.ini: PHP5 treats text with a leading '0' like
      '09' as an octal number, which we cannot use.


Version 0.7b - September 5, 2004
--------------------------------
    - updated bank list

    - fixed validators: 88, 52

    - implemented validators: B1, B2


Version 0.7a - August 16, 2004
------------------------------
    - reimplemented validator: 05

    - fixed validators: 24, 61


Version 0.7 - August 2, 2004
----------------------------
    - BAV_Bank::getBLZ() is deprecated. Use BAV_Bank::getID() instead.

    - reimplemented validator because of notices: 22

    - dropped XML support as there is really no need at the moment

    - added PHPDoc documentation

    - added a layer for Postgresql

    - changed the implementation of BAV_BankSaver_SQL::_save(),
      because Postgres doesn't know REPLACE

    - The BankID index has to be quoted, as Postgres should cast
      it to fit to an index.

    - Every SQL Query uses now ' instead of " as quotes.

    - added ANALYZE and VACUUM to installation

    - README was updated.

    - added BAV_Controller::isInvalid()

    - added BAV_Bank_Extended and removed it again. I hope it has
      been removed completely.

    - replaced import_* and install* with bav_install.php

    - fixed unimportant bug in BAV_Validator_KontoCheck

    - fixed BUG with static table in BAV_Validator_KontoCheck,
      which affected PHP 4.3.0.

    - BAV_Validator_KontoCheck does a preNulls() on the validated IDs. This
      is a workaround for the old validators, which expected to validate
      normalized bank IDs.


Version 0.6a - July 1, 2004
---------------------------
    - fixed Validators: 13, 50, 87

    - added verifyImport.php

    - checkValidators.php searches also for verfahren_* calls.
      There seems to be no more.


Version 0.6 - June 28, 2004
---------------------------
    - fixed Validators: 93

    - The install_* scripts don't print "#!/usr/local/bin/php" now.

    - The Factory for the file of the Bundesbank doesn't use file() anymore,
      so the memory amount is still below the 8 MB limit.

    - Changed the SQL structure for the tables.

    - the install_* scripts will now print error messages from the import_* scripts

    - Because of the few changes (which aren't very serious) this release
      might be one of the last beta releases.

    - update of the banklist.txt


Version 0.5 - May 1, 2004
-------------------------
    - bav.php reads interactively also the \n which made the bank unknown.

    - fixed Validators: 00, 10, 25, 28, 29, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 43, 44, 47, 51,
                        73, 78, 81, 88, A0, A1

    - implemented Validators: 52, 53, 54, 58, 66, 71, 72, 74, 75, 80, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87
                              89, 90, 92, 93, 96, 97, 98, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8

    - reimplemented because of Notices: 14, 16, 23, 26, 40, 64, 68, 77

    - BAV_Validator_Waighted had a serious bug which caused wrong validation results
      if a validator object is used more than once.

    - splitted BAV_Validator_Waighted into BAV_Validator_Waighted and its new
      super class BAV_Validator_Iteration. BAV_Validator_Iteration can be used by other
      validators like BAV_Validator_Transformation.

    - added BAV_Validator_Tranformation as new abstract super class for validators which
      are using transformation tables.

    - example/full.php used the old path.

    - added BAV_Validator_Multi as abstract super class for validators which implements
      several validation algorithmns.

    - BAV_Validator_06 was modified, in order to be reusable by more validators

    - BAV_Validator_02::__construct()'s parameters were modified, in order to be reusable
      by more validators

    - checkValidators.php recognizes more accurant which validators are buggy.


Version 0.4 - April 27, 2004
----------------------------
    - BAV_ValidationResult distinguishes betweend unknown bank
      and unknown algorithm. So exit codes of bav.php and result codes of
      BAV_ValidationResult have changed.

    - corrected Validators: 81 (a half).

    - checkValidators.php uses verify.txt to check the corectness of the algorithms.
      This is still in Beta, because I don't know how these bank accounts should be
      treated for real.

    - change of banklist.xml structure. This file is still unused, but it is prepared
      to contain all the data for exporting (including test accounts).

    - BAV_BankFactory_SQL::getBank($bankID) is safer, because it escapes the bankID
      with BAV_SQL::escape()

    - There is no need to define BAV_ROOT_PATH, this will be done in config/paths.php
      So you have only to care about the correct include of config/paths.php.

    - config.php uses per default the hashtable, so you can use BAV without installing
      any database.

    - added BAV_Controller to hide all the BAV_* classes (like BAV_Bank, BAV_Factory,
      BAV_Account) and provide a more simple interface. But you can and should still
      use the old way to validate an account. This class is intended for users which
      are not scripting so object oriented.


Version 0.3a - April 22, 2004
-----------------------------
    - BAV_Validator_42 was not implemented correctly.


Version 0.3 - April 22, 2004
----------------------------
    - BAV adds support for an unified standard constructor __construct()

    - New powerfull abstract class BAV_Validator_Waighted and its subclass
      BAV_Validator_Waighted_Default. These classes offer support for iterating
      through waighted algorithmns.

    - Implementation of Validator_56, Validator_57, Validator_91, Validator_A9.
      So 34 more Bank IDs are supported.

    - Validator_01 and Validator_06 were rewritten, in order to be used by
      other Validators. So these two Validators are verified.

    - Validator_08 and Validator_79 were only slightly verified by
      checkValidators.php, and there were return values missing.
      They've been patched, but the algorithms were not verified!


Version 0.2a - April 5, 2004
----------------------------
    - BAV is inherited explictly from stdClass.

    - The Script's path is detected correctly by using __FILE__
      instead of $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'], which is not available
      on every platform.

    - BAV_Validator::crossSum() is fixed.

    - corrected and rewritten algorithm for Validator_63


Version 0.2 - March 20, 2004
----------------------------
    - The data source changed. The old text file will no more be supported.
      Instead the text file of the Deutsche Bundesbank is supported. This file
      is included in this package and also located in a ZIP archiv at
      <http://www.bundesbank.de/zahlungsverkehr/zahlungsverkehr_bankleitzahlen_download.php>

    - Bank name support is completely removed (it even wasn't implemented
      completely), because several banks have the same BLZ. So the datastructures
      only saves the relation between BLZ and validation algorithm.

    - Class model was slightly improved (the BAV_BankFactory_File hierarchy).

    - XML support was added. This will be usefull in future releases, when
      the validator is responsable for different countries. All different data
      sources will be exported in one single XML document. So a user needs only the
      XML document to update his validator.

    - bav.php was added. This is a command line validator.
      It may operate interactively or takes the parameters from the command line.
      It throws exit codes, so it may be used by other command line scripts.

    - Bug with the default bank constructor was fixed.

    - All files have a licence note.

    - This Changelog was added

    - Scripts are independent of the CWD.

    - the BAV_BankFactory gets a singleton object which will be initialized in
      the central config file config/config.php.


Version 0.1 - March 15, 2004
----------------------------
    - This is the first release. It comes with generated and fixed validators and
      several data structures (serialized hashtable, SQLite and an import script
      for MySQL). As source for the data structure a text file from the original
      project (php_kontocheck) is used.
